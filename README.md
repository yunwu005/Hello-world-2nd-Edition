# Hello-world-2nd-Edition

Hi All,
I am very new to coding.  I spent few hours on codecademy.com here and there to learn python.  I found it is very interesting and would like to learn more and get better.

This is my second hello-world repository.  Not so funny story.  I following the tutorial to creat my first every repository and discovered i did something wrong and cannot move forward with the second step.  So here I am, redoing it.  Promise to following instruction closely and make this one a success!
